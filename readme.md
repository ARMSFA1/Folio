#### Sprint One

##### Sprint Achievements

<p>**Note taking** was a powerful tool for us during this sprint. We were constantly jotting down bullet points in our notes. With these, we were able to get a better understanding of how we wanted to tackle the situation.</p>


<p>During the first meeting with our client, we had several focused questions that I had gathered from our group. I believe that this will result in targeting where the work needs to go. The answers to these questions then soon moved on to become *user stories*</p>

<p>**Having** experience with the software engineering process, I was more aware of the points that we should be talking about early. The topics that I suggested and asked about were;</p>

>   *Scrum and it's applications to our project.*

>   *Asking our client to sit down and go through our user stories to ensure they're on focus.*

>   *The system we'll attempt to apply to sprints and user stories.*

The result of this being that we start our sprints completely organized. All the user stories were created following a agreed format, the labels were designed to identify exactly what we expected we'd need during our work.

##### Personal Reflection

<p>**I** feel like I did a really good job this sprint about getting everyone invovled. It really helped everyone get out of their shell and relax a bit, but I definitely think it's helped us achieve our goals. There's always a bit of an awkward period at the start of a group where everyone's sizing each other up and trying to figure out how they fit in. I think I, *partialy*, helped ease this *process*</p> 

<p>**Uncertainty,** there was definitely a large aspect of the process that gets a little hampered when no one is really sure about what another team member is thinking or wanting to do in the project. One of my team members was pretty hard to talk with, I tried to engage with him a few times, but the most that was heard from him was his name and a 'hello'. I think I'll have to look for alternative means of communicating with him, as it is possible he's more comfortable sharing ideas over text *communications.*</p>

#### Sprint Two

##### Sprint Achievements

<p>**Communial** notes was something that the team agreed would be a good idea once I had shown them a few demonstrations. The idea of the system being to create an retrospective tagged closed issue which would include a series of notes for what it was we did and what aspects of work we focused on. I believe that this will be incredibly helpful in the later weeks of the semester where we're working to remember details from weeks ago. Perhaps more importantly, is it's aid in ensuring that the work we're doing is focused on exactly what the clients specifically asked *for*</p>

<p>**The** second sprint was actually a bit of a disaster when looked at as a whole. A lot of work didn't get completed that we thought would. Our schedules never aligned and we were very often completely unsure of what our teammates were doing. A keypoint we identified in our sprint reflection, was the difficulty in communication with one another on a consistent level. In response to that, I went ahead and make the software engineering team a slack channel, which we'll be able to talk both with each other and our client very immediately and *easily.*</p>

![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/lf8kJzl.png "Slack")

<p>**Reflection** on our past efforts was extremely helpful when formulating an idea on how to move forward. We've added sprint retrospectives to our completed sprints. These go over what it was that went well, what went wrong and how to improve it.</p>

##### Personal Reflection

<p>**Communication** was an incredibly massive issue during this sprint. Moreso than, I think, any of us really expected. The team has extremely few classes in common, meaning the only way we had to talk to each other was emails and in class. However, if someone doesn't show up to class or check their emails for any reason you're often left completely in the dark about what's being worked on by other members of your team. I decided that the best way to get around this would be to create a slack channel. Slack, is essentially, a instant messaging program. Through this we've been able to create different channels to discuss the work we're doing or struggling with, as well as a second for talking directly with our customer. </p> What did you do well, what did you learn, what barriers did you encounter, what could have been improved.

<p>**I** had attempted to set up a meeting with our customer, Grayson. However, I failed to confirm the meeting time once he responded to me. This resulted in our group standing outside his empty office for ten minutes before leaving. The solution to this one being, of course, would be to not take anything for granted when dealing with a customer.</p>

> ### Point of Interest
> <p> My grandfathers health was deteriorating extremely quickly, during the beginning of a global pandemic. Obviously, Covid-19 was very much a thing that I intend to discuss going further down the line. My very immediate family received permission from the government to travel to Oamaru to assist with end of life care. Not wanting to go into too many details, I was essentially absent from class and any ability to work for roughtly two weeks, not mentioning the few days off I took after returning to Dunedin to collect myself. This issue compounds itself with the fact that we decreased the amount of time given to each sprint, meaning that my missed team appears much more meaningful.</p>

> <p> I intend to add notes and points of interest where I can, but the emptiness in certain areas over the next three sprints is related to that. I hope that this was the most appropriate way to go about it, as a lot of it are things that I would like to avoid speaking about. </p>

<p>**N/A**</p> 

##### Personal Reflection

<p>**Knowing** that I was likely to be gone for an extended period of time and not wanting to leave my team members out of the loop, I made sure to inform each of them individually with the exception of Thomas Beckwith, who has seemingly vanished. There wasn't all too much I was able to do with the time frame allocated to me before my departure, so the best that I was able to do was explaining the situation and apologizing for being unavailable temporarily. Given more time, I would have liked the ability to discuss how each of the projects can be done, however it simply wasn't an option. </p>

#### Sprint Five

##### Sprint Achievements

<p>**Adapting** to the way the team was working now and the progress that we'd made in the last couple of weeks was pretty intimidating at first. Not only, was the production schedule massively pumped up, but at the same time the things that were being worked on were completely unfamiliar to me. However, due to the currently ongoing global pandemic, I had a lot more time at home. When I was eventually in a place where I was ready to sit down and was mostly doing touch up jobs on other code. Simple things like fixing a typo, improving the appearance of the profile section and adding links to our header. I think despite how turbulent these times are, some upsides do exist, such as being able to get all of your energy out when you do suddenly get an 'ah-hah' moment. *para*</p> 

<p>**This** Was actually some of the hardest coding that I had touched so far on the project. Although, as I'd soon come to find it wasn't that difficult at all, it was a massive ramp up from the minor tweaks that I was used to. I think my actual coding knowledge is definitely my weakest point. My target to get around that is to work on a few bugs and touch up jobs that involve replicating existing working code so I can understand why it's built the way that it is. </p>

> ![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/WsSOTDV.png "Example of my work")


##### Personal Reflection

<p>**I** definitely think there's a massive degree of catch up that I'm going to have to do. I still need to come to terms properly with the new schedule and barriers to learning, but in a way that seems to almost be helping software engineering. It's a strange concept to come to terms with in my opinion. The idea that since the rest of our classes are struggling to function, software engineering which is relatively autonomous was nearly completely uneffected. </p> 

<p>**Communication** has been incredible since I've arrived back. We're doing three voice meetings a week, discussing what we're doing, what we're struggling with and giving quick advice and then finally to reflect on the sprint and identifiy what happened. It's been amazing for keeping me on track, knowing that I always have a deadline around the corner massively boosted my productivity. I sincerly hope we can continue this in the future.</p>

> ![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/dbt7YgC.png "Slack being used")

<p>**We** were left to come to the conclusion that we'd be doing the rest of the project with only three team members. This came with a degree of stress, especially compounding with the swap one week sprints. I think that moment was a big motivator for all of us, as from that point onwards our professionalism has been increasing exponentially. I think that the system we've set up to work in is strong enough to handle the increase in difficulty. </p>

#### Sprint Six

##### Sprint Achievements

<p>**Largest** amount of code I've implemented in a single sprint so far. I hadn't had any controller coding experience at this point. All of my work was very much on the front end, getting everything sorted for back end to come through. It's very much a different kind of coding, and one that I earnestly don't have much experience with. I think this was a really good opportunity for me to learn quite a lot while working. It was very satisfying figuring out exactly why and how things work the way that they do. </p>

> ![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/Zh8Az6M.png "My work on the controllers")

<p>**We** discovered a way to work in groups more efficently this sprint. It's by using a plug-in for visual studio code called Live Share, as well as screen sharing capabilities of Citrix Workspace. It's definitely a level of co-operative coding that's not really possible when you're both staring at the same computer screen. Live Share allowed multiple programmers to work on someone's branch of code simultaniously, thus not needing to constantly push and pull on git. Citrix workspace was more for showing off bugs and deciding on how to fix them.</p>

>  ![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/b7VOqYQ.png "Live Share")

##### Personal Reflection

<p>Communication has been becoming more and more of an issue in the last few weeks, which is what lead us this sprint to utilizing pluggings and outisde programs in order to work together. I think they're definitely a favorable advantage to have. </p> 

<p>**I'm** beginning to find a new found sense of appreciation for coding. It was previously, by far, my most disliked portion of the whole project, but after really getting invested into it, I think I'm doing really well progressing.</p>

#### Sprint Seven

##### Sprint Achievements

<p>**With** the rest of our classes suddenly picking up in pressure, we're able to ease off of the gas slightly this week to compensate. Due to the system we've set up, we're able to keep up the exact formula and complete finished code at the end of each week without having to put ourselves into an unhealthy state of crunch. It really did ultimately become a question of, 'which is more important, my backlog or my mental health'. There's a lot of stress everywhere right now, not wanting to go into too many details, but the pandemic keeping everyone indoors isn't seeming like it'll be going away anytime soon. A healthy team is a lot more productive than a un-healthy one.</p>

<p>**A** lot of my effort this sprint was focused on helping a team mate who was getting a big bogged down with other classes. Being able to call them up, jump on the same page and muscle through some work together is such a benefit. It's really hard to fall through the cracks, I'd like to hope, with the way we're working right now. </p>

##### Personal Reflection

<p>**Perhaps** just with the nature that everything is in right now, it might actually be impossible to get a solid week where you feel like you've accomplished anything massive. Having to ease off of the work load was definitely a decision that came down to the wire, but at the end of the day I think it was the right one. I was impressed that despite the outside stresses that everyone was going through that we were still able to be delivering functional code on time for our customer. </p> 

<p>**Seeing** that my team mate was struggling with the motivation to get through anything this sprint was pretty rough. I know I've definitely been in that position before, so being able to keep them on track by agreeing to duo a job is super beneficial. It's kinda hard to slack off when you're both working on it. </p>

#### Sprint Eight

##### Sprint Achievements

<p>**I** think that by this point everyone has pretty much settled into the flow of things for the rest of the semester. The work coming out isn't amazingly huge, but it's functional, it works. We're hunting out bug fixes whenever we have spare time too. I was really starting to get the feeling that the website was going to be ok. It was very much because we stuck to our guns that it didn't tumble over and crash along the way. 

<p>**Javascript** was a solution I came to for one of my bugs that I attempted to fix.</p>

> "Enter only kilojoules or calories not both"

<p>Essentially, the error was that you could enter two wildly different answers for kilojoules and calories when submitting snacks or drinks on the website. Which meant that two values which were meant to equate to identical digits were massively out of tune. The solution that I came up with was formulated using a javascript insert.</p>

> ![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/gB1n1Y9.png "My javascript")

<p>This would then be put in place for all of the submit fields, meaning that once the calorie value is entered for example, an equal kj value would also be entered into the other field, ensuring that they always match. This hit a snag however, after we were seemingly unable to get it to work on a single data entry point for reasons I couldn't understand in time in order to solve them before the sprint ended, leaving them unfixed as of yet.

##### Personal Reflection

<p>Not finishing on time was definitely something that shook me up. I had been pretty confident about my progress all sprint so it took me off guard. I think that in the future I can minimize the risk of a random bug messing me up by getting to the functionality stage a lot faster when working. </p>

<p>I'm pretty excited about how much I'm able to get into this more complicated problems and really attack them with a sense of direction that was previously lacking with my level of skill in the past. As a result of this, I'm able to go about my work much more confidently than in the past.</p>

#### Sprint Nine

##### Sprint Achievements

<p>**Sprint** nine was definitely a unique experience. Despite my team being full of determination when it came to work before, everyone seemed to have been over it for the most part this week. There were a few calls and comments that nothing was worth starting and there weren't any bugs small enough to fix in time, but I think it genuinely was just quite a stressful period of time with other classes. I managed to work a little on two issues, neither of which ended up getting finished. I had to admit to myself that if I couldn't solve my bug in regards to my kilojoules to calorie converter I would simply remove the option for a bug to appear. Simply only having a calorie option, then converting that to kilojoules on the page submit. Unfortunately, this wasn't really meant to be as it didn't get completed before the end of the sprint. </p>

<p>**Testing** was a major focus of mine during this sprint. I hadn't exactly had much experience with it working out at all in the past, so I didn't have the most confidence in it. I decided to get it testing on a feature I had recently fixed, which was the navigation bar. The test is to run through the options for each navbar selection and then check to see if it ended up in the right place. I was pretty impressed with how easy it was to do once I watched a few tutorials of. It definitely seems like the kind of thing that only gets subsequently easier the more that you do it.</p>

##### Personal Reflection

<p>**Going** as this is to be my last personal reflection in my portfolio I think it's fair to summarize my thoughts on the project as a whole up to this point. I have honestly been really surprised with just how well the Agile system has help up when really applied and focused on in ways that your group finds meaningful. Despite getting knocked around a lot, we were always able to bounce back up and keep pace.w</p> 

> ![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/iS1xhFh.png "123 commits!")

<p>Testing is something that I wish I had gotten into earlier so I really could have polished it by now. It seems like something that I'd be really into with how methodical the systems for it are, which is something that I've found personally appealing when it comes to work. I'm definitely going to keep practicing it in my time off.</p>

### Agile Evidence

> #### Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

<p>Francis Peña Rosas states *“frequent communication in agile results in better performance of the development team and therefore, a better final product.”* In the opening section of her [article](https://trifinlabs.com/communication-in-agile/).<br> The initial question within The Piers quickly became; how are we going to maintain consistent communication? From past experience, I knew all too well how quickly messing this up could sink a team before they even get off of the ground. Obviously, we had the option of communicating face to face during class time, but that left out the customer and was extremely limited in when we were actually able to do it. Conflicting schedules ensured that another approach would need to be taken. Our solution, initially, was to use an email group and keep each other informed that way.</p>

> ![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/7hVPc28.png "Arranging to meet with the customer")

<p>Email came with its own set of difficulties. Due to the semi-formal nature of it, it was difficulty to quickly communicate over a task at hand and arranging meetings with our customer became a nightmare, as often either one of us or our customer would end up not knowing about it.</p>

> ![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/F7Fe1co.png "Time confusion") <br>
> **The result of how clumsy email can be.**

<p>Thankfully, Agile is a fairly dynamic system, allowing for us to course correct with minor inconvenience to our work flow.</p>

<p>For our sophomore effort, we knew we needed something that was both easily accessible and to communicate over. Anything which didn’t fit into these criteria had to be ignored. To achieve the level of communication required to work within Agile, we knew whatever we settled on had to be as close to perfect as we could get. Settling on //Slack’s// business communication platform, we quickly found out that it had everything we required of it. It was easy enough to leave a tab of our browsers open on it, meaning that we’d get an instant notification whenever a group member posted in it, as well as being able to instantly reply. Furthermore, it also meant that we were able to bring out customer directly into our communication system.</p>

![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/tGCrjr2.png "Grayson on Slack")

<p>This massively ramped up the project. It was only through regular and to the point communication both within our team and with our customer that we were really able to thrive.</p>

<p>Working with Slack meant we were able to quickly get updates from our customer about their requirements, update each other about absences or other difficulties and seek help with our tasks.</p>

<p>The Covid-19 pandemic which was beginning to truly sweep the world definitely added a complication to proceedings. Suddenly we’d lost our best method of communication, face to face. While messaging over Slack was extremely effective for what we initially had needed it for, we were now facing new requirements.</p>

<p>Inspired by the way classes were being run at our Polytechnic, with students and teachers able to communicate both with voice and web-camera’s, we quickly took to applying to technology to our own work style. Stand up meetings would be arranged on Slack for a specific time, where a [Citrix Workspace](https://www.citrix.com/en-nz/products/citrix-workspace/) link would be given out, allowing for the team to congregate together and quickly and efficiently perform our stand up meetings.</p>

<p>Stand up meetings consisted of three major questions as suggested by Michael Lum’s blog post on the website [Sprint.ly](https://sprint.ly/blog/scrum-meeting-best-practices/):</p>

> What did you accomplish since the last meeting?

> What are you working on until the next meeting?

> What is getting in your way or keeping you from doing your job?

<p>Occuring twice a week, I found them extremely helpful on keeping on task. Prior to their consistent use within our group it was extremely easy to fall between the cracks, so to speak. I often found my allotted work waiting around until the very end of the sprint, where it was completed in a rush, thus degrading the quality of our work. I found that regularly touching base with each other was a large incentive to keep on track. After all, you don’t want to be the person showing up a stand up meeting without anything to show for themselves.</p>

<p>Placing the work on a much more comfortable pace, I began working in a much more sustainable manner, doing a consistent amount of work every few days, rather then rushing it all at once. This links into the Agile principle, as defined by [Agile Alliance](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/) **”Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.”**</p>

> #### Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software

<p>The decision was made halfway through our work time to shorten the length of our sprints. Sprints previously lasted two weeks, however the access to a lot more free time as the result of the virus, we elected to shorten it to a single week. This meant we were able to consistently deliver code at a rate that wouldn’t have been possible before. This wasn’t a perfect trade however. There were user stories that were simply too large to finish in a single week. This meant that some problems had to be broken into pieces which would result in working code for our customer. There’s a focus on delivering working code as a target within Agile, something that I found a struggle to fit into our current system. However, after a few weeks at the new pace, it felt incredibly natural and without any real issue. I was certainly able to delivery work at a continuous and much faster pace than before; this reflects the Agile principle in question.</p>

<p>I wrote up a series of user stories for our customer to critique. These were needs that various people who use the website would have. Initially, they were given two looks over by the group, fine tuning them and getting them exactly to the point of what we wanted to do. I decided to ask our customer, Grayson, to look through our work, to make sure we were delivering exactly on the marks he wanted. Focusing our attention on code that wasn’t necessary could have potentially resulted in some interesting features; however, to the customer it would ultimately be useless as it doesn’t address what they need. I found it a little difficult at first to detach myself from thinking that the first way we wrote a user story was the most efficient. Ultimately, a lot of the user stories that I contributed to the project ended up getting changed to match the customer’s wishes, but this resulted in a lot more targeted work at exactly what they wanted, thus making the code delivered much more valuable.</p>


![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/MqpoR3O.png "user stories 1")
![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/u0hLSKc.png "user stories 2")

<p>Kanban Boards were used to both allocate and keep track of a sprints progress. Seperated into four seperate coloumns, they allow for a quick way to visualize what needs done. This allowed us to keep up a real time tracker of each others actions and progress within the group. On a sprint completion, seeing which user stories need to be closed and which need to be added onto the next board was incredibly easy. Our kanban board was also used to assign team members to specific tasks. Being able to focus on exactly the tasks at hand was a benefit in determining what jobs you'd be able to apply your strengths to, ensuring that everyone is getting a task that they can handle.</p>

![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/CtkOfLl.png "Kanban Board")

<p>Kanban board's have a small amount in common with the next feature I'd like to discuss, pull requests. Pull requests allows all the code that goes into the dev branch to be moderated from other team members. Ensuring that all eyes go on whatever it is being pushed through. As you can see on our kanban board, we had a 'Review' column. This column existed to represent the user stories that were finished, but waiting to be approved by another team member. This massively increases the chance that a bug or error will be caught out before being put onto the live branch, thus damaging the customer.</p>

<p>Through the use of these two tools, I believe I was able to massively improve the consistency with the amount and quality of code that we're pushing out.</p>

> #### At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly

<p>Sprint reviews were largely by my implementation. The goal was to take a moment to collect our thoughts and reflect back on the strengths and weakness of the team. The format that was settled on was extremely similar to that of our stand-up meetings, being a series of three questions.</p>

> What went well?

> What to improve?

> Solutions?

<p>The goal being to hone in on our strengths and weakness and then determining how to amend those weaknesses. I definitely found them effective, often going through our Git-Hub repository, I would come across an old sprint review and remind myself about the solutions we’d set for ourselves. It ended up becoming a natural part of the work flow, fitting in perfectly with the system that we’d established.</p>
